<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p>The object of this study is to produce a picture of the
private soldier of the American Revolution as he lived, ate, was
punished, played, and worshiped in the army camp. Drawing that
picture not only from the standpoint of the continental congress,
the body which made the rules and regulations for governing the
army, or from the officer's view point as they issued orders from
headquarters rather just a study of the soldier himself in the camp
conditions and his reaction to them. It was easy for congress to
determine the rations or for the commander-in-chief to issue orders
about housing conditions and sanitation, but the opportunities for
obeying those orders were not always the best. It is just that fact,
not what was intended, but what happened, that is to be discussed.</p>

<p>The soldier in camp is an aspect of the Revolutionary
War which has been taken up only in a very general way by writers
of that period of history, except perhaps the conditions at Valley
Forge, for at least their terrible side is quite generally known.
Charles Knowles Bolton has studied the private soldier under Washington<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor"><sup>1</sup></a>,
but has emphasized other phases of the soldier's life than
those taken up in this study.</p>

<p>The material has been gathered mostly from letters,
journals, orderly books, and diaries of the officers and privates,
written while in camp. The difficulty confronted has been to get
the diaries of the private soldier. They have either not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
published or if they have been published they have been edited in such
a way as to make them useless for a study of social conditions in
camp, the emphasis having been placed on the military operations and
tactics rather than the every day incidents in the soldier's life.</p>

<p>The soldier has been studied after he went into camp.
Little has been said about the conditions which led to the war or
the conditions as they were before the struggle began except as they
are used to explain existing facts. It has been the plan in most of
the chapters to give a brief resume of the plans made by congress
or the commander-in-chief for the working out of that particular
part of the organization, then to describe the conditions as they
really were.</p>

<p>There has been no attempt made, for it would be an almost
impossible task, to give a picture of the life in all the
camps but rather the more representative phases have been described
or conditions in general have been discussed.</p>

<p>The first phase of camp life considered is that of the
housing conditions, the difficulties encountered, the description
of the huts, the method of construction, and the furnishing. This
is followed in the second chapter with a study of the food and
clothing, the supply and scarcity of those necessities. The
third chapter will have to do with the health and sanitation of
the soldier while encamped, the hospital system, the number sick,
the diseases most prevalent and the means of prevention. The
soldier's leisure time will be the subject of the fourth chapter, the
sort of recreation he had been in the habit of at home and the
ways he found of amusing himself in camp conditions. The soldier's
religion forms the subject matter of the fifth chapter, the influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
of the minister before the war, his place in the army, the
religious exercises in camp and their effect upon the individual
and the war in general. The last chapter will in a way be a recapitulation
of all that has gone before by drawing a picture of a
day with a soldier in camp emphasizing the discipline and duties of
camp life.</p>

<h2>Chapter I<br />
<span class="small">HOUSING CONDITIONS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The war was on, the Lexington and Concord fray was
over, Paul Revere had made his memorable ride, and the young patriots
with enthusiasm at white heat were swarming from village and countryside
leaving their work and homes. Where they were going they
did not know, they were going to fight with little thought of where
they were to live or what they were to eat and wear. There was a
continental congress but it had little authority and the fact was
that very few members of that mushroom growth army even felt that
they were fighting for a confederation for in their minds they were
for the various states, and it was to the various states they looked
for support and it was to those states that the honors were to go.
It was not until the day before the battle of Bunker Hill that congress
had appointed a commander-in-chief and it was almost a month
later when Washington took command in Boston. There was an army of
sixteen thousand men mostly from the New England States strengthened
by about three thousand from the more southern states during the next
month<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor"><sup>2</sup></a>. It was more nearly a mob than an army. There was no directing
force, no one to superintend the building of barracks, no
one to distribute food or to take charge of the supplies.</p>

<p>The Provincial Congress of Massachusetts on hearing of
Washington's appointment ordered on June 26, 1775 "the President's
(of the college) house in Cambridge, excepting one room, reserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
for the President for his own use, be taken, cleared, prepared,
and furnished for the reception of General Washington and General
Lee"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor"><sup>3</sup></a>. It seems as though the General only occupied that house
for a short time and then moved to what was called the "Craige House"
for on July 8, 1775, the committee of safety directed that the house
of John Vassel, a refugee loyalist, should be put in condition for
the reception of the commander-in-chief and later that his welfare
should be looked after, by providing him with a steward, a housekeeper,
and such articles of furniture as he might ask for.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Such were the headquarters of the first camp of the
Revolution but the story of the privates' quarters is quite a different
thing. The troops were not quartered at one place, they were
scattered about the surrounding territory some at Roxbury, some at
Winter Hill, others at Prospect Hill and Sewall's Farm and at various
small towns along the coast.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor"><sup>5</sup></a> Some of them were living in houses
and churches, others were occupying barns<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor"><sup>6</sup></a> and still others were
constructing their own places of shelter using sail cloth, logs,
stones, mud, sod, rails or anything else which would lend itself
to the purpose.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor"><sup>7</sup></a> A good description of this motley host is given
us by Rev. Wm. Emerson of Concord, "the sight is very diverting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
to walk among the camps. They are as different in their form as the
owners are in their dress and every tent is a portraiture of the
temper and taste of the persons who encamp in it. Some are made of
boards, some of sail cloth, again others are made of stone and turf
brick or brush. Some are thrown up in a hurry, others curiously
wrought with doors and windows done with wreaths and withes in the
manner of a basket".<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor"><sup>8</sup></a> Washington wrote from Cambridge to congress
on July 10, 1775 about a month after taking command and said, "we
labor under great Disadvantages for want of tents for tho' they
have been help'd out by a collection of now useless sails from the
Sea Port Towns, the number is yet far short of our Necessities"<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor"><sup>9</sup></a>.</p>

<p>When tents were used for shelter at Cambridge or at
other places it was very seldom that any thing more than "Mother
Earth" served as floors and sometimes that was so wet and miry that
the soldiers during the rainy seasons were forced to raise the ground
with "Rushes, Barks, and Flags in the dry"<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor"><sup>10</sup></a> and at other times the
tents were taken down during the day for the ground to dry and then
put up again at night.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to get any where more frank reactions
to housing conditions than those which were given by Dr.
Waldo<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor"><sup>11</sup></a> in a poem written while in camp describing the general conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
but particularly the tents and huts. The part quoted below
describes a stormy day and the hardships endured when the army was
encamped in tents.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>As the weather grew colder and the men were still in
tents it was the practice to build chimneys<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor"><sup>13</sup></a> on the tents or rather
in front of the tents. They were built on the outside and concealed
the entrance which served the double purpose of keeping out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
the wind and also keeping in as much heat as possible.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>The tents were supposed to house about six men and no
more than fourteen tents were allowed to a company of about seventy
two.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor"><sup>15</sup></a> The tent was the most common mode of housing. It was used
whenever it was possible to get material except when the army went
into winter quarters then the log huts were built. The tents were
usually formed in two ranks in regular lines<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor"><sup>16</sup></a> and often the seasons
advanced so rapidly that the snow would be four feet deep around
each tent<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor"><sup>17</sup></a>, it even being February before the huts were finished
in some instances<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor"><sup>18</sup></a>.</p>

<p>The furnishings of the tents were very meagre, one
person even remarking that they were greatly favored in having a
supply of straw for beds. The straw was placed on the ground and five
or six soldiers would crowd together on it hoping to keep warm<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor"><sup>19</sup></a>,
sometimes each had a blanket and sometimes there was one blanket for
three or four. The sentry was instructed to keep the fire burning
in the chimney outside<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor"><sup>20</sup></a> which added a little to the comfort.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<p>When the army went into winter quarters the soldiers
were a little more comfortable. Morristown and Valley Forge were
the two representative winter quarters. The location of these permanent
camps was usually chosen because of the ease with which
building materials could be obtained or because there was easy access
to food supplies.</p>

<p>As orders came to go into winter camp the men were divided
into companies of twelve. Each group was to build its own hut
and lucky was the group which happened to get the most carpenters,
for General Washington offered a prize of twelve dollars to the
group in each regiment which finished its hut first and did the
best work.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>While the men were busy cutting the logs and bringing
them in, the superintendent appointed from the field officers
marked out the location of the huts. They were usually in two or
three lines with regular streets and avenues between them, altogether
forming a compact little village.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor"><sup>22</sup></a> The space in front of the huts

<p>The only tools the soldier had to work with were his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
axe and saw. He had no nails and no iron of any sort, just the
trunks of trees to cut into the desired lengths and a little mud
and straw.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor"><sup>25</sup></a> Each hut was fourteen by sixteen feet, with log sides
six and one-half feet high. The logs were notched on the ends and
fitted together in a dovetailing fashion. The spaces between the
logs being made airtight with clay and straw. The roof was a single
sharp slope that would shed the snow and rain easily, made of timbers
and covered with hewn slabs and straw. There might be boards
for the floor, but often there was not even a board to use for that
purpose and just dirt served instead. Each hut inhabited by privates
had one window and one door, the officers quarters usually had two
windows. The windows and doors were formed by sawing out a portion
of the logs the proper size and putting the part sawed out on wooden
hinges or sometimes in the case of windows the hole was covered with
oiled paper to let in light. The door was in one end and at the
opposite end a chimney was built, built in a manner similar to the
hut itself except that it was made of the smaller timbers and that
both the inner and outer sides were covered with a clay plaster
to protect the wood from the fire.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor"><sup>26</sup></a> The huts were in one room
usually, except the officers and theirs were divided into two apartments

<p>The above description no doubt applies in general to
any of the winter quarters. Often the camp was better situated
for obtaining the necessary supplies and, too, after the soldiers
had built one such town of huts the next would be better because of
their experience. The camp at Morristown was better than the one
at Valley Forge.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor"><sup>28</sup></a> The quarters were large and huts were built
to be used for social affairs such as dances and lodge meetings.</p>

<p>When the army was only stationed at a place for a short
time as for instance when they were encamped near the enemy planning
an attack and did not care to build the more permanent quarters,
which took more time to complete, and when living in tents was not
practicable, they built what the French called baroques, which
could be thrown up in a day or two.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor"><sup>29</sup></a> These temporary quarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
consisted of a wall of stone heaped up, the spaces between filled with
mud, and a few planks formed the roof. A chimney was built at one
end and the only opening was a small door at the side of the chimney.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<p>When the army was on the march the soldiers carried
their tents with them if it was possible but a great many circumstances
arose which made that impossible. Then they had a hut of
brush or sod or even just sky to cover and protect them<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor"><sup>31</sup></a>. At other
times they slept in barns or churches,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor"><sup>32</sup></a> or where ever they could
find a place.</p>

<p>As might be expected the furnishings of the huts were
of a very meagre sort. There were beds of straw usually on the
floor or else raised from the floor to get away from the dampness.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor"><sup>33</sup></a>
Each man was supposed to have with him his own blanket and cooking
utensils, but it often happened that there was but a kettle or two
for the whole company.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor"><sup>34</sup></a> Since the actual necessities were so meagre,
there surely were no unnecessary articles. There were none of those
things which would tend to make the camp quarters the least bit
like home. One man describes the difficulty of finding a place to
write and ends by saying that the railing in a near by church was
the best place.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor"><sup>35</sup></a> The only light they had was furnished by candles
which were a part of every man's rations and the tallow from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
cattle killed for camp use was made into candles.</p>

<p>The men crouched together in those huts and the poor
ventilation coupled with the fact that the only means of heating
was an open fire place which sent about as much smoke into the
room as it did out through the chimney produced a condition which
was almost unbearable.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

<p>From this study it would seem as if there were at
least three classes of barracks, the tents used when practicable,
the huts for winter quarters, the barroques for temporary housing,
and if one wanted to mention a fourth, it would be just any
place where ever a soldier might lie down.</p>

<p>When the housing situation is looked at from one angle
the view is of the worst possible, but when on the other hand one
realizes that each time the troops went into camp the whole process
had to be gone through with from the cutting of the logs to the
moving into the huts and beside that they had no tools, the whole
thing seems wonderful.</p>

<h2>Chapter II<br />
<span class="small">FOOD AND CLOTHING</span></h2>
</div>

<p>If the problem of housing was a serious one and one
which caused a great amount of suffering the question of food was
even more serious. The theory of getting the food for the soldiers
was all very simple, but not so simple in practice. According to
theory the various colonies were apportioned the amount they were
to supply and were to deliver their portion to the camp which might
be designated by the commander-in-chief. The lack of authority of
congress which played havoc so many times with the smooth running of
affairs also played havoc in the commissary department.</p>

<p>The apportionment plan was carried out to some extent,
but of course was not to be depended upon for often the colonies
got the supplies to camp, but more often they did not. The amount
to be supplied was divided up among the inhabitants of the states,
in the case of meat some giving one hundred and fifty pounds and
others one hundred and eighty pounds according to their ability.
The other supplies were divided up in the same way. When a given
community was ready to send their supply some of the farmers would
take the job of driving the cattle to the camp, receiving about a
dollar a day and expenses while they were traveling.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p>A Frenchman who traveled in America during the revolutionary
period told of his experience when he tried to get a room
in an inn, which was filled with farmers on their way to camp with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
a herd of cattle. In that particular group there were thirteen men
and two hundred and fifty cattle.</p>

<p>July 19, 1775, Joseph Trumbell was made commissary general
of stores and provisions<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor"><sup>38</sup></a> by the continental congress. November
4, of the same year the following resolution was made in congress
in regard to the rations of the private soldier. "Resolved,
that: A ration consist of the following kind and quantity of provisions
viz.:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>1 lb. of beef, or &#190; lb. pork or 1 lb. salt
fish, per day.</p>

<p>1 lb. bread or flour per day.</p>

<p>3 pints of pease or beans per week, or vegetables
equivalent, at one dollar per bushel for pease or
beans.</p>

<p>1 pint of milk per man per day or at the rate of
1/72 of a dollar.</p>

<p>1 half pint of rice, or 1 pint of indian meal
per man per week.</p>

<p>1 quart of spruce beer or cider per man per day,
or nine gallons of molasses per company of 100
men per week.</p>

<p>3 lb. candles to 100 men per week for guards.</p>

<p>24 lb. of soft or 8 lb. of hard soap for 100
men per week."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>


                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>The rations mentioned in orderly books or journals were
the same as the above except that butter was added in some cases
and a pint of rum was allowed on the day a man was on fatigue duty
or on special occasions,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor"><sup>40</sup></a> but in the large the rations given at the
beginning of the war by congress were followed whenever there were
supplies enough to admit of any definite plan being followed.
The officers received rations according to their rank.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<p>Thus would have ended the story of the revolutionary
soldiers food if the theory had been practicable, but as it was
not, there is a different story to tell. The conditions on the
march to Quebec with Arnold were almost unendurable. The march was
only started when the soldiers were put on short rations receiving
three-fourths of a pound of meat and bread instead of a whole pound,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor"><sup>42</sup></a>
and as they proceeded the conditions only grew worse until when they
were not yet nearing their destination the last of the flour was
divided. There were just seven pints for each man. That amount was
to last seven days, thus each man had a pint a day to live on and
that had to be divided into a gill for breakfast, half a pint for
dinner and the remaining gill for supper. It was mixed with clear
water with no salt and laid on the coals to heat a little and then
was nibbled as the soldiers marched on or else it was boiled like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
starch and eaten in that fashion.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor"><sup>43</sup></a> It happened sometimes that some
soldier had the good fortune to kill a partridge, much to his joy,
for that meant soup could be made.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor"><sup>44</sup></a> The condition only grew worse
instead of better and all the food was gone, the next move was to
kill the dogs which were in camp<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor"><sup>45</sup></a> even the legs and claws were boiled
for soup. When the situation had become so acute that the soldiers
had given up their moose skin moccasins to boil in an attempt to get
a little nourishment,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor"><sup>46</sup></a> a moose was killed, a halt was called and soup
was made for the hungry soldiers of the entire animal, hoofs, horns
and all.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

<p>If we follow the division of the army which was sent
against the Indians in Sullivan's expedition in 1779, the conditions
will be found to be somewhat different for that march was made during
the summer and fall rather than fall and winter as the march to Quebec
had been, and besides the western campaign was into a country
which abounded in beans, peas, corn, cucumbers, pumpkins, squashes,
and watermelons.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<p>The soldiers were short on rations<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor"><sup>49</sup></a> and out of bread,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
but it was not felt so keenly because of the substitutes they could
get.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor"><sup>50</sup></a> The main object of the expedition was to devastate the Indian's
land and one duty was to destroy or take all the food which came in
their way. When the soldiers came to a field of corn, their first
duty was to feast on it and then destroy all they could not use or
carry away with them.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor"><sup>51</sup></a> If the corn was in a condition for roasting,
they did that or made succatash; if it was too hard for roasting
they converted some old tin kettles found in the Indian villages into
large graters by punching holes in the bottom. Then one of the
military duties of the soldiers was to grate the corn into a coarse
meal which was mixed with boiled pumpkins or squash and kneaded into
cakes and baked on the coals<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor"><sup>52</sup></a> and even that coarse food was relished
by the men when fatigued after a long march.</p>

<p>This rather amusing entry, yet terrible if true, is
found in one diary of the expedition "July 7&mdash;I eat part of a fryed
Rattle Snake to day which would have tasted very well had it not

<p>The conditions in the camp were somewhat different than
those on the march for in camp what the rations were depended on the
amount of supplies. If they were plentiful, full rations could be
drawn by each soldier, but when they were scarce each soldier had
to take less. The time and place of drawing supplies seemed to vary
with circumstances, and no definite plan was followed.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<p>It is a mistake to think that the soldier of the American
Revolution was always suffering for the want of food. The picture
drawn for us most often is that of the distressing conditions.
There was a brighter side, although it is true that the soldier
suffered many times. When the camps were situated in or near an
agricultural community the farmers swarmed to camp with their produce
charging exorbitant prices, but if the soldier had any money
he was usually willing to buy. In the course of eight days the
caterer of a single mess purchased three barrels of cider, seven
bushels of chestnuts, four of apples, at twelve shillings a bushel,
and a wild turkey<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor"><sup>54</sup></a> which weighed over seventeen pounds.</p>

<p>In winter when there was no produce to be brought in
and no way of securing provisions the story was not so bright.
The conditions at Valley Forge are quite well known. How the rations
were cut down until it was "Fire cakes and Water" for breakfast,
and water and fire cakes for dinner<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor"><sup>55</sup></a> or how the soldiers ate
every kind of horse feed but hay<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor"><sup>56</sup></a>, and often they were without meat
for eight or ten days<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor"><sup>57</sup></a> and longer without vegetables.</p>

<p>Supplies were gathered from every conceivable source,
sometimes cows were part of the supply company, taken along for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
purpose of supplying milk. One man writes in his diary his appreciation
of a cow which supplied them milk on the march with Sullivan's
expedition.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor"><sup>58</sup></a></p>

<p>The methods used at that time for cooking seem very simple
and inefficient now. Huge bake ovens were built in the camp
and whenever there was flour to use, bakers baked the bread for the
camp.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor"><sup>59</sup></a> The quality of the bread furnished in that way was certainly
not beyond reproach for often it was sour and unwholesome.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor"><sup>60</sup></a></p>

<p>There were huts built for kitchens, one for each company
and there the soldiers took turns cooking for their company<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor"><sup>61</sup></a>
or else each soldier cooked his own food over an open fire. At
times the fuel became so scarce that the fences<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor"><sup>62</sup></a> around the camp
were torn down and burned, and after that the food had to be eaten
raw because of the lack of fuel.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor"><sup>63</sup></a> If there was material to be
used for fuel and other supplies some distance from the camp, it
was no uncommon sight to see soldiers yoked together acting the part
of horses<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor"><sup>64</sup></a> in order to get the supplies to camp.</p>

<p>Today, this question of food for the revolutionary
soldier, in the light of present day events, looks rather inefficient
and unscientific.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<p>When there was plenty the soldiers feasted, when food
was scarce they fasted, but it must be remembered that there was
no dependable supply, no directing force, and no distributing agency,
and beside those hindrances there were no ways of preserving food
as there are today.</p>

<p>A naked or half clothed army did not make a very imposing
looking force, even if they did have a place to live and something
to eat. They had to have something to wear if they were to meet the
enemy on the field. Steuben wrote "The description of the dress is
most easily given. The men were literally naked some of them in
the fullest extent of the word. The officers who had coats had them
of every color and make. I saw officers at a grand parade at Valley
Forge mounting Guard in a sort of dressing gown made of an old blanket
or woolen bed cover".<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor"><sup>65</sup></a> This description, no doubt was appropriate
for part of the army, part of the time, but not for all the army
all the time.</p>

<p>The troops as they were assembled at Boston did present
a peculiar picture, each person wearing the costume best suited to
his individual notion of a suitable uniform, with a tendency toward
frill, ruffles, and feathers, each thinking that the gorgeousness
added to the dignity and effectiveness of the whole. Some were in
citizens clothes, some in the hunting shirt of the back-woodsman,
and some even in the blanket of the Indian, for, it was the notion
of some, that riflemen should ape the manners of the savage.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor"><sup>66</sup></a></p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<p>Washington took the matter into consideration and
wrote congress "I find the Army in general and the Troops raised
in Massachusetts in particular very deficient in necessary clothing
upon Inquiry there appears no probability of obtaining any supplies
in this quarter and the best consideration of this matter I am able
to form I am of the opinion that a number of hunting shirts not less
than ten thousand would in a great Degree remove this difficulty
in the cheapest and quickest manner I know nothing in a Speculative
view more trivial yet if put in practice would have a happier Tendency
to unite the men and abolish those provincial Distractions which
lead to jealousy and dissatisfaction".<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor"><sup>67</sup></a></p>

<p>He suggested the hunting shirt because it was cheap
and "besides it is a dress justly supposed to carry no small terror
to the enemy who think every such person a complete marksman".<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

<p>It was decided that the hunting shirt should be used
and also that the continental government should supply the clothing
and then ten per cent of each man's wages should be withheld each
month.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor"><sup>69</sup></a> The quartermaster general had charge of the clothing supply
and at regular intervals he was supposed to distribute clothing to
the soldier, but the supply varied to such an extent that no regular
plan could be followed.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span></p>

<p>The following was considered an ordinary man's outfit
for a year:</p>


<ul class="index">
  <li class="isub2">Two linen hunting shirts,</li>
  <li class="isub2">Two pairs of overalls,</li>
  <li class="isub2">A leathern or woolen waist coat with sleeves,</li>
  <li class="isub2">A pair of breeches,</li>
  <li class="isub2">A hat or leathern cap,</li>
  <li class="isub2">Two shirts,</li>
  <li class="isub2">Two pair of hose,</li>
  <li class="isub2">Two pair of shoes.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor"><sup>70</sup></a></li>
</ul>


<p>The whole was to amount to about twenty dollars.</p>

<p>The soldier was considered in full uniform when he
appeared on parade with "a clean shirt, leggings or stockings,
hair combed, shirt collar buttoned with stock. Hunting shirt,
well put on hat".<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor"><sup>71</sup></a></p>

<p>Since the material for the hunting shirts was difficult
to get, the officers as well as the men were to dye their shirts in
a uniform manner.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor"><sup>72</sup></a></p>

<p>The different ranks of a soldier were shown by the hunting
shirt. A captain's was short and fringed, the private's short
and plain, the sergeant's was to have a small white cuff and be
plain, and the drummer's was to have a dark cuff. Both officers and
soldiers were to have hats cut round and bound with black, the brims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
of the hats were to be two inches deep and cocked on one side with
a button and a loop, and a cockade which was to be worn on the left
side. There was also a distinction made by the wearing of a certain
colored cockade in the hat. The field officers were red or pink,
the captain yellow or buff, and the subaltern green.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor"><sup>73</sup></a></p>

<p>The material for the soldier's clothing was supplied by
the various colonies. The following resolution is typical of
numerous ones passed by the different colonies. "That a quanity
of home made cloth or other if that can't be obtained as far as
may be of a brown or cloth colour, sufficient for three thousand
coats and the same number of waist coats and as many blankets as
can be obtained in the colony 3000 felt hats, cloth of check Flannel
or some linen if that can't be obtained sufficient for six
thousand shirts and also six thousand pairs of shoes"<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor"><sup>74</sup></a> or as in
Massachusetts a committee was appointed to collect four thousand
pairs of stockings.</p>

<p>The material after being collected was made up by regimental
tailors, the commanding officer was to make a report as to
the number of tailors employed in the regiment and also whether
there were not more tailors in the regiment than were employed
in making clothing.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor"><sup>75</sup></a></p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<p>The women at home aided very materially in the clothing
problem by their spinning, knitting and collecting of linen.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor"><sup>76</sup></a>
When persons called on Mrs. Washington, whether she was at home or
in camp, they usually found her knitting and she had sixteen spinning
wheels running at one time.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor"><sup>77</sup></a> Other women all over the country
followed her example.</p>

<p>Instances, almost without number, are mentioned in diaries
and journals of the nakedness of the army, some without shoes,
with only pieces of blankets wrapped around their feet,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor"><sup>78</sup></a> thousands
without blankets,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor"><sup>79</sup></a> others with their shirts in strings,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor"><sup>80</sup></a> and added
to all that the paymaster without a dollar and the quartermaster
in almost the same situation.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor"><sup>81</sup></a></p>

<p>Even the soldiers had to suffer from the want of clothing
yet they were able to see the funny side of the situation.
The story is told in one diary of a party that was given by an officer
for which invitations were extended to all, the only restriction
being that no one with a whole pair of breeches could be admitted.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor"><sup>82</sup></a></p>

<h2>Chapter III<br />
<span class="small">HEALTH AND SANITATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The health of the soldier was not entirely forgotten.
Those in authority made an attempt to prevent or at least to lessen
the pain and suffering of those who were taken sick or were wounded
in army service, but often the measures of prevention instituted,
the methods of checking contagion and the means of allienating pain
were of the crudest sort and to us of the twentieth century they
seem almost inhuman. It must be remembered that not even our simple
remedies of today were known then, not to mention our modern
methods of combating disease.</p>

<p>The continental congress thought of that phase of army
conditions and on July 25, 1775, the following provisions were made.
For an army of twenty thousand men a hospital was to be established
under the direction of a Director General, his salary was to be
four dollars per day. He was to superintend the whole, furnish
the medicines and bedding and make a report to and receive orders
from the commander-in-chief. Under the director there were to be
four surgeons, one apothecary and twenty surgeons' mates, each receiving
two-thirds of a dollar per day, whose duty it was to visit
and attend the sick. There was also to be a matron who had under
her direction the nurses, one for every ten sick soldiers.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor"><sup>83</sup></a> Then
in July 1776, the resolution was passed that the number of hospital
surgeons and mates was to be increased in proportion to the increase
in size of the army not to exceed one surgeon and five mates to
every five thousand men and to be reduced as the army was reduced.</p>

<p>Dr. Church was appointed by congress as director, but
before October 14, 1775, he had been taken into custody for holding
correspondence with the enemy<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor"><sup>84</sup></a>, and on October 17, 1775, Dr. Morgan
was elected in his stead.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor"><sup>85</sup></a> But even after the new director was appointed
there was still room for complaint for Washington wrote to
Congress "I am amazed to hear the complaints of the hospital on the
east side of Hudson's river. * * * I
will not pretend to point out the causes; but I know matters have
been strangely conducted in the medical line. I hope your new appointment
when it is made, will make the necessary reform in the
hospital, and that I shall not, be shocked with the complaints and
looks of poor creatures perishing for want of proper care, either in
the regimental or hospital surgeons".<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor"><sup>86</sup></a></p>

<p>Congress had made several attempts to organize the hospitals
and in July 1776, resolutions had been passed which defined more
fully the duties of the various officials both of the departmental
and the regimental hospitals.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor"><sup>87</sup></a> There was to be a director and under
him the directors of the various departmental hospitals.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor"><sup>88</sup></a> But since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
there were only a few departmental hospitals and those few often a
long distance from the scene of battle it became necessary to have
branch hospitals or regimental hospitals. At the head of those
were persons known as regimental surgeons, who were to make reports
of expenses, and lists of the sick to the director of the departmental
hospital and receive supplies from him.</p>

<p>The plan was then that the soldiers were to be cared
for by the regimental surgeon as long as it was possible and then
they were to be sent to the departmental hospital for further care.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor"><sup>89</sup></a>
These two systems seemed to interfere with each others work and
there was always jealousy existing between the director of the general
hospital and the surgeons of the regiment. "There will be
nothing but continued complaints of each other; the director of the
hospital charging them with enormity in their drafts for the sick
and they him with the same for denying such things as are necessary.
In short there is a constant bickering among them which tends greatly
to the injury of the sick * * *
The regimental surgeons are aiming, I am persuaded, to break up the
general hospital."</p>

<p>The two most representative departmental hospitals
were, it might be said at Bethlehem and Sunbury, but there were others
at Reading, Lititz and Ephrata. Bethlehem was a Moravian village
and was in the midst of military affairs almost continually from
1775 to 1781; in fact it was twice the seat of a hospital. On
December 3, 1776, an order was sent to the committee of the town of
Bethlehem as follows:</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span></p>

<p>"Gentlemen,&mdash;According to his excellency General Washington's
Orders, the General Hospital of the Army is removed to
Bethlehem and you will do the greatest Act of humanity by immediately
providing proper buildings for their reception the largest and
most capacious will be the most convenient. I doubt not, Gentlemen
but you will act upon this occasion as becomes men and christians
* * * "<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor"><sup>90</sup></a></p>

<p>It was by the above process that the little peace loving
village of Bethlehem and many others like it were thrown into
confusion and dwelling houses or other buildings were turned into
hospitals, the men began to play the part of nurses, to help care for
the sick and dying sent from camp, and the women prepared lint and
bandages. The buildings which under ordinary circumstances could
accommodate about two hundred were made to accommodate five or
six hundred.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor"><sup>91</sup></a></p>

<p>The housing accommodations of the regimental hospitals
were even more varied, for they were housed in any thing from a
capital building<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor"><sup>92</sup></a> to a log hut,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor"><sup>93</sup></a> including private homes,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor"><sup>94</sup></a> church,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor"><sup>95</sup></a>
barns, and court house,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor"><sup>96</sup></a> depending upon what happened to be near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
the camp. A hut or group of huts were sometimes built for the
purpose in or near the camp. They were built in a manner similar
to the dwelling huts<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor"><sup>97</sup></a> only larger with furnishings as meagre, straw
for the bed<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor"><sup>98</sup></a> tells the tale of equipment.</p>

<p>But the hospitals were of little value if there were
not able physicians<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor"><sup>99</sup></a> and antiseptics and anaesthetics were almost
unknown. Besides the lack of skill and proper medicine and instruments,
for some of the instruments described are almost unconceivable,
there was a lack of cleanliness in conducting the operations
for that was not insisted upon then as it is today.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor"><sup>100</sup></a> Of hospital
methods Dr. Waldo wrote December 25, 1777, "But we treat them
differently from what they used to be at home under the inspection
of old women and Doct &mdash;&mdash;, We give them mutton and Grogg and
avoid pudding, pills, and powders."<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor"><sup>101</sup></a> This perhaps was a little
extreme, but it at least reflects the conditions. Thacher described
the awful condition in which soldiers came to the hospital with
wounds covered with putrified blood and full of magots which were
destroyed by the application of tincture of myrrh.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor"><sup>102</sup></a></p>

<p>Director-General Shippen, in explaining the causes of
the mortality among the soldiers attributed it to; "The want of
clothing and covering necessary to keep the soldiers clean and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
warm, articles at that time not procurable in the country;&mdash;partly
from an army being composed of raw men, unused to camp life and
undisciplined; exposed to great hardships and from the sick and
wounded being removed great distances in open wagons."<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor"><sup>103</sup></a></p>

<p>As to the kind of disease most prevalent and the number
in the hospitals because of sickness in proportion to those
there because of injuries, some idea can be formed from the hospital
reports sent in weekly from the departmental hospitals.</p>

<p>Although some of the diseases listed in the reports are
unknown to us now and there is no way of knowing what the proportion
the sick was of the entire army in that section. However, the returns
do state the number sick during the various seasons, and
show in which season of the year there was the most sickness.</p>

<p>The following are the returns from the Sunbury hospital
for the four seasons of the year, spring, summer, fall and winter.</p>

<p>If the above tables are any index at all the most
dangerous season was summer in spite of the crowded unsanitary conditions
of the winter quarters. They also show that the number in
hospitals due to sickness was larger that the number due to injuries
received in battle.</p>

<p>Smallpox was one of the most dreaded of all the diseases,
mostly because there were few ways of combating the disease. Inoculation
was only slightly known and there was much opposition to it,
even sermons were preached on the question it was so much discussed.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor"><sup>108</sup></a>
The British knew the New England people were especially opposed to it
and were known to send out spies to spread the disease in the American
camp which Shreve wrote "killed more Yankees than they did".<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor"><sup>109</sup></a></p>

<p>The disease was especially serious in the Northern army
causing greater dread than the enemy.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor"><sup>110</sup></a></p>

<p>Thacher in his <i>Military Journal</i> emphasizes another disease
which caused a great deal of suffering but strange to say there
was only one remedy for it and that was a furlough for the disease
was home-sickness. In reality that was a fact which caused anxious
moments for General Washington for the men were continually trying
to bribe the physicians to declare that they were unfit for duty.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor"><sup>111</sup></a></p>

<p>Other provisions were made for the health of the soldiers
besides the establishment of hospitals. The others were along the
line of prevention, such as keeping the tents and huts clean and dry,
the careful preparation of food, the washing of clothes, caring for
refuse,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor"><sup>112</sup></a> and the soldiers own personal cleanliness.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor"><sup>113</sup></a></p>

<h2>Chapter IV<br />
<span class="small">RECREATION IN CAMP</span></h2>
</div>

<p>If there must be a certain proportion of work and play
in every one's life to make for efficiency, then the soldier of the
Revolutionary War was far below normal in the scale of efficiency
for recreation in any organized form is found to have been entirely
lacking.</p>

<p>But before too severe a judgment is placed upon this
lack of recreation the conditions the soldier left at home must be
studied. Recreation as such had not been a part of his daily routine.
It has been estimated that nine-tenths of the people lived in rural
districts leaving only one-tenth for the cities,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor"><sup>114</sup></a> an estimate which
no doubt is true. The people had never thought of the problems of
bad housing, congestion, or recreation. They had had the whole of
nature for their home and the whole of the frontier to wrestle with.</p>

<p>Speaking of the people a generation or two later, Dr. F.
L. Paxson says in <i>The Rise of Sport</i>, "The fathers of this generation
had been sober lot unable to bend without breaking, living a life of
rigid and puritanical decorum interspersed perhaps with disease and
drunkedness, but unenlivened for most of them by spontaneous play."<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor"><sup>115</sup></a></p>

<p>Thus in studying the life of the soldier at home before
he went into the army camp, even the slightest traces of twentieth
century recreation are found to have been lacking, but that does
not mean that those people never forgot their work. It would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
hard to find a more hospitable group. They were never too busy to
entertain. There was the occasional jollification with rum or beer,
the card party, the ball, the concert, the theater, and of a more rural
type the picnic and the "corn husking".<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor"><sup>116</sup></a></p>

<p>The conditions in camp were different than those at home.
The problems of bad housing, congestion and recreation were then factors
to be considered. There was the small unsanitary and poorly
ventilated hut with twelve to sixteen men and sometimes even more
crowded into it. When the troops first went into winter quarters
there was plenty to do in the way of exercise for there were logs
to cut and huts to build, but those were soon completed and the men
were crowded together with nothing to do.</p>

<p>Something had to happen, the monotony of the dreary days
had to be broken. This was brought about in several ways.</p>

<p>Often the punishments ordered by the court martial were
administered publicly in camp just to enliven the common routine.
When a man was sentenced to death, but had been pardoned by those
in charge, the force of going through the punishment was carried out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
The condemned man was brought to the side of his newly dug grave,
he was bound and blind-folded, the firing party got in position,
the fire lock even snapped, and as might have been expected, the culprit
sometimes died of the shock.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor"><sup>117</sup></a></p>

<p>The hanging of a man was a gala day in camp and the
place of hanging was almost as popular as an amusement park of today;
"Five soldiers were conducted to the gallows according to their sentences.
For the crimes of desertion and robbing the inhabitants,
a detachment of troops and a concourse of people formed a circle
around the gallows and the criminal were brought in on a cart sitting
on their coffins and halters about their necks"<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor"><sup>118</sup></a></p>

<p>It was frequently stated in the sentence given by court
martial that the punishment whatever it was, riding the wooden horse,
riding the rail, receiving the biblical "Thirty-nine" lashes, or
running the gauntlet,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor"><sup>119</sup></a> was to take place at some time when all the
soldiers were together as at the beating<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor"><sup>120</sup></a> of the retreat or at the
head of the regiment.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor"><sup>121</sup></a> Punishments ordered by court martial in that
way served two purposes. They furnished amusement for the soldiers
at the same time the purpose for which they were intended, that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
making an example of the misbehavior of one of the soldiers.</p>

<p>While the Virginia riflemen were in camp at the siege
of Boston there was a practice which served both as a source of
amusement and as a display of marksmanship. There were two brothers,
one of whom would place a board five inches wide and seven inches
long with a bit of white paper in the middle of it about the size
of a dollar, between his knees while the other at about sixty yards
distance would shoot eight bullets through it without injuring the
brother.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor"><sup>122</sup></a></p>

<p>The duel was another common practice which seemed to
furnish amusement besides deciding the honor of some individual.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor"><sup>123</sup></a></p>

<p>Hunting, too, was a means of cheering the dreary days,
but this too was often "Killing two birds with one stone", for often
the soldiers went hunting to provide the regular rations, but at
other times it was done just for the sake of the sport to be found
in it. The following is taken from a New York paper of December
12, 1785. "A Fox hunt. The Gentlemen of the army with a number of
the most respectable inhabitants of Ulsler and Orange purpose a Fox
Hunt on the twenty third day of this instant to which all Gentlemen
are invited with their hounds and their horses. The game is
plenty and it is hoped the sport will be pleasant * * * "<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor"><sup>124</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Along with the hunting frays went fishing<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor"><sup>125</sup></a> and nutting<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor"><sup>126</sup></a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
trips which added a little variety to the ordinary camp scenes.
There were several days celebrated by the Americans at that time
which meant a holiday for the soldier with perhaps an extra allowance
of rum<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor"><sup>127</sup></a> or meat. Some of those days were Christmas, Thanksgiving,
Fourth of July, May day, Commemoration of the French Alliance,
or a celebration following a victory. The celebration usually
consisted of a parade, a sermon by the chaplain followed
by a banquet and perhaps a dance for the officers, and extra rations
for the privates.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor"><sup>128</sup></a></p>

<p>Another celebration mentioned by several diaries and
one which seemed to be a joyful occasion was as one writer said
"and (we) convert(ed) the evening to celebrate as usual wives and
sweethearts which we do in plenty of grog".<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor"><sup>129</sup></a></p>

<p>There were a few games which served to shorten some of
the long dreary days for the soldier, some of them were; fives,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor"><sup>130</sup></a>
shinny,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor"><sup>131</sup></a> goal,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor"><sup>132</sup></a> ball<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor"><sup>133</sup></a> and a kind of football.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor"><sup>134</sup></a> No description of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
above games has been found, but to judge by the context they were
all outdoor games.</p>

<p>The diversions discussed so far in this chapter have
all been outdoor games, but the real test came when the soldiers
were crowded into the huts during the winter months with nothing to
think of but their own miserable conditions. Since no one had thought
of organizing the soldier's leisure time he had to invent something
for himself. The first things thought of, naturally, were the amusements
which had existed at home. Card playing came to his mind, but
in the army the game of cards or any other game of chance was absolutely
forbidden by order of congress and the commander-in-chief.
"Any officer, non-commissioned officers, or soldier who shall hereafter
be detected playing at toss up, pitch and hustle or any other
games of chance in or near the camp or villages bording on the encampments
shall with out delay be confined and punished for disobedience
of orders * * * The general does not
mean by the above order to discourage sports of exercise and recreation,
he only means to discontinuance and punish gaming".<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor"><sup>135</sup></a> In another
order Washington said, "Men may find enough to do in the service
of their God and their country without abandoning themselves
to vice and immorality".<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor"><sup>136</sup></a></p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<p>Dancing had been another form of entertainment at home
but that too was usually impossible because of the lack of room.
That was especially true at Valley Forge and other camps, but at
Morristown, however, a large room in the commissariat store house
was reserved for dancing,<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor"><sup>137</sup></a> lodge meetings, and the like for the masons
had chapters in the army camps.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor"><sup>138</sup></a></p>

<p>At home the soldier had also had his friends and dinner
parties, now he had soldier friends, but the only way for him to keep
in touch with former friends was by letters and that was a very irregular
and uncertain way for mail could only be sent from camp or
brought to camp when some one was going home on a furlough or new
recruits were coming into camp.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor"><sup>139</sup></a> The nearest the soldier came to
his social dinner and evening at home was the rallies from barracks
to barracks when every body who could sing sang.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor"><sup>140</sup></a></p>

<p>As for the officers in camp, their leisure time was better
provided for. They lived in better quarters, generally, at least
larger ones. They, too, had the advantage of being entertained at
the homes of the people living in the vicinity of the camp. Even
if one's imagination must be drawn upon in order to make the recreation
of the private seem recreational, at least, there was a side of
camp life which presented a more pleasant picture "If our forefathers
bled and suffered they also danced and feasted."<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor"><sup>141</sup></a> The letters and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
diaries of the young officers tell of the gaiety of the war. Even
in midst of the gloom at Valley Forge there was drinking from cabin
to cabin and dinners in honor of visiting foreigners. No sooner was
the army in winter quarters than the ladies began to appear, for
Mrs. Washington, Mrs. Greene, and Mrs. Knox made it a practice to
spend the winters with their husbands. Mrs. Washington was in the
habit of saying that she always heard the last cannon fired in the
fall and the first one in the spring.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor"><sup>142</sup></a></p>

<p>As soon as the wives appeared, the gaiety began among the
families of the officers, the dinner was the favorite method of bringing
the families together. "General Greene and his lady present
their compliments to Colonel Knox and his lady and should be glad for
their company tomorrow at dinner at two o'clock".<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor"><sup>143</sup></a> Often the dinners
were in name rather than in reality, for officers and privates
suffered alike when food was scarce, but the social time did not
depend entirely upon the supply of food. One such dinner is described
as having been potatoes with beech-nuts for dessert.</p>

<p>The usual round of pleasure for the officers was dancing,
dinners, teas, sleighing parties, horse-back parties, or the celebration
of some day or event. Of the dance General Greene wrote on
March 19, 1779, "We had a little dance at my quarters a few evenings
past. His excellency and Mrs. Greene danced three hours without one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
sitting down upon the whole we had a pretty little frisk".<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor"><sup>144</sup></a>
Another such affair is described as follows: "There were subscription
balls in the commissary store house at which Washington in black
velvet, the foreign commanders in all their gold lace, General Steuben
being particularly replendent and the ladies in powdered hair, stiff
brocades and high heels made a brilliant company."<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor"><sup>145</sup></a></p>

<p>In the large it can be said that, the recreation of the
American soldier during the Revolutionary War, was invented to supply
the need felt rather than an institution thought out before.
Some of the practices would hardly be classed as recreation, but
they helped to break the monotony and that was the object desired
whether it was by enjoying a fellow soldier's punishment or playing
an innocent game of ball.</p>

<span class="small">RELIGION IN THE CAMP</span></h2>
</div>

<p>"It is earnestly recommended that all officers and
soldiers diligently to attend Divine Service and all officers and
soldiers who shall behave indecently or irreverently at any place of
Divine worship shall if commissioned officers be brought before a
court martial there to be publicly and severely reprimanded by the
President, if non-commissioned officers or soldiers, every person
so offending shall for his first offence forfeit one sixth of a
Dollar to be deducted out of his next pay, for the second offence
he shall not only forfeit a like sum but be confined for twenty-four
hours and for every like offence shall suffer and pay in like
manner, which money so forfeited shall be applied to the use of
the sick soldiers of the troops or company to which the offender
belongs."<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor"><sup>146</sup></a></p>

<p>The continental congress in its acts for the regulation
of the Army issued the above orders. Orders also came from headquarters
directing the soldiers actions along religious lines.
"All officers see that their men attend upon prayers morning and
evening also the service on the Lord's Day with their arms and accouterments
ready to march in case of any alarm, that no Drums to
be beaten after the parson is on the stage".<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor"><sup>147</sup></a></p>

<p>But the religion of the American soldier was more than
an order from the provincial congress or from headquarters. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
an influence which was an important factor in the soldiers life and
in the war. In the American Revolution perhaps the religious element
was not the paramount factor as it had been in the crusades or the
Puritan Revolution giving character to the whole movement, it rather
stayed in the back ground and supported the political and military
organizations.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor"><sup>148</sup></a></p>

<p>The pulpit had been a factor in shaping the soldier's life
before he left home, it was a day when newspapers and other means
of disseminating ideas were not very plentiful and the pulpit was
about the only way of reaching the majority of the people. It is
said of one minister who was famous for his bold sermons and his
purely political discourses although they were delivered from the
pulpit he "knows all our best authors and has sometimes cited even
in the pulpit passages from Voltaire and Jean Jaques Rousseau".<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor"><sup>149</sup></a></p>

<p>The house of representatives of Massachusetts saw the value
of the clergy in shaping public opinion and passed a resolution asking
them to make the question of the rights of the colonies a topic
of their discussions on week days. The pulpit, too, had its place
in the election campaign. There was preached before the governor
and house of representatives of Massachusetts what was called the
"election sermon". It was a sermon preached by the best ministers
of the colony, not exactly as a mere compliment to religion, but with
the object in view of instruction. The ministers did not only deliver
dissertations on the doctrinal truths, but they discussed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
rights of men, the nature of government and theories of liberty
and equality. The sermons delivered on such occasions do not
seem to be impracticable theological discourses, but rather on the
other hand very practicable. The questions of the day being subjects
discussed; for it was through the medium of the church that
the people received the foundation for their beliefs in political
affairs.</p>

<p>On Monday the 29th of May, 1771, John Tucker of Newbury
preached the election sermon on the text "Submit yourselves to
every ordinance of men for the Lord's sake whether it be the king
as Supreme". From that as a text he went into a discussion of the
sort of submission which was due to the rulers. In 1773 Charles
Turner preached from Romans and tried to show why it was the right
and duty of the clergy to enter into politics. The next year when
excitement was reaching its height it is interesting to note the
sort of text Rev. Hitchcock of Pembroke took for the basis of his
sermon. It was from Proverbs XXII, 2, "When the righteous are in
authority the people rejoice but when the wicked bear rule the people
mourn".<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor"><sup>150</sup></a> It is not hard to believe that just such sermons and
many others like them had some thing to do with the Revolution as
well as Navigation Acts and Correspondence Committees. Of course
it must be said that since the people did not rise as one man there
was another view to take on the question, but the people were
guided in the opposite view also by the clergy.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor"><sup>151</sup></a></p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>

<p>The clergy did more than discuss politics from the pulpit
before the conflict broke for when the war was on in earnest and
troops were being raised the ministers left their pulpits to take
their place in the army not always as chaplains, but sometimes in
the ranks and sometimes as head of the company. In one company of
minute men from Domeers the deacon went as captain and the minister
as lieutenant.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor"><sup>152</sup></a> Besides the part played by the clergy, the church
as a whole was one of the forces working for the care and comfort
of the American Soldier. The churches were turned into barracks
and hospitals.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor"><sup>153</sup></a> Messages of the officers of the army describing
the soldiers' conditions in camp were read from the pulpit on Sunday
Morning; the afternoon congregation would be made up almost entirely
of men, and the women were to be found at home knitting or spinning.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor"><sup>154</sup></a></p>

<p>When Washington assumed command of the army at Cambridge
he found chaplains attached to different regiments sent from various
colonies, especially from the New England colonies. Some of these
were volunteers without pay and others were appointed by the provincial
congress.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor"><sup>155</sup></a></p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p>The chaplain of that war was not like the chaplain of
the present time. A sort of half-soldier, half-minister, never expected
to fight or endure the hardships of the private; on the other
hand he was one of the men on the field, but also reverenced by the
soldiers because of the place he had filled in their activities at
home.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor"><sup>156</sup></a></p>

<p>At first, as has been noticed, there was no regulation
concerning the appointment and pay of the chaplain by the continental
congress. Washington wrote to congress in December 1775 and said,
"I need not point out the great utility of gentlemen whose lives
and conversation are unexceptionable being employed for that service
in the army".<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor"><sup>157</sup></a>   He went on to suggest plans whereby all regiments
might be served by a chaplain. The plan which congress adopted was
of having a chaplain for every two regiments and they fixed the salary
at thirty-three and one-third dollars a month.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor"><sup>158</sup></a> The plan worked
when the soldiers were in camp, but not when they were on the march.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor"><sup>159</sup></a>
In 1776 a chaplain was allowed for each regiment.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor"><sup>160</sup></a></p>

<p>According to the regulations of the army, there were to
be prayers morning and evening,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor"><sup>161</sup></a> and on Sunday services were almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
continuous. There were always two services and often more, the
chaplains from the various regiments preaching in rotation.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor"><sup>162</sup></a></p>

<p>The places of holding religious meetings varied with
circumstances, services were held in a church<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor"><sup>163</sup></a> in or near camp, on
a college campus,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor"><sup>164</sup></a> in an opening in the woods,<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor"><sup>165</sup></a> and in a log hut
built for the purpose.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor"><sup>166</sup></a> When the army entered Cambridge, the next
day was Sunday and a stage was erected on the campus by turning up
a rum hogshead.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor"><sup>167</sup></a> On another occasion a pulpit was formed out of
knapsacks piled together.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor"><sup>168</sup></a></p>

<p>The kind of sermons provided by the chaplains to the
soldiers makes an interesting study, they were always of a practicable
nature. The sermons seemed to fall into two general classes,
one class setting forth the characteristics of a good soldier,<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor"><sup>169</sup></a> and
the other those which had to do with the political and social troubles
of the time.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor"><sup>170</sup></a></p>

<p>There are records of the attitude of the soldier being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
changed very materially by some of the sermons heard both concerning
his own personal attitude<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor"><sup>171</sup></a> and his attitude in general toward
the war. The story is related that one time Rev. Gano knew that
a number of the soldiers in his audience were men who had only enlisted
for a few months, hence during the service he made the remark
"he could aver of the truth that our Lord and Saviour approved
of all those who had engaged in His Service for the whole warfare".
The rank and file were much amused and those who enlisted for the
whole war forced many short-term men by their jesting to re-enlist.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor"><sup>172</sup></a></p>

<p>Another observance which might be considered part of the
soldier's religion, was the day of fasting and prayer ordered by
congress and the officials of the various colonies.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor"><sup>173</sup></a></p>

<p>There is yet one more effect which grew out of the religious
activities of the soldier while in the army camp. That is
the weakening of the rigid lines which had been drawn between sects.
When the soldier was at home he was, Presbyterian, Anglican, Catholic
or what not, but in the army there was a tendency to forget the
barriers; both Protestant and Catholic services were held, but it
was one of the orders of Washington that no person should make
light of another's religion.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor"><sup>174</sup></a> It had been the custom of the people
near Boston to celebrate what was called "Pope Day" when they burned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
an effigy of the Pope; the soldiers were contemplating a celebration
of this custom when Washington issued orders against it calling it
a "ridiculous and childish custom."<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor"><sup>175</sup></a></p>

<p>The fact that the chaplain of a regiment might have
members of a number of sects in his audience would tend to create a
common interest, and also the fact that whenever the troops were near
a church they were ordered to attend regardless of denomination.
The incident is related of Washington who was Anglican that he and
a number of his men, asked a Presbyterian minister to give them
communion in his church, and it was gladly done.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor"><sup>176</sup></a> All of which
were factors in bringing about democracy in the church.</p>

<p>The soldier's day began with reveille at sunrise or
"when a Sentra Can See Clearly one thousand yards around him and not
Before"<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor"><sup>177</sup></a> and ended with tat-too heating at eight o'clock;<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor"><sup>178</sup></a> for after

<p>Between reveille and tat-too there were numerous duties
to be performed and orders to be obeyed. Some of them seemed foolish
and most unnecessary to the average soldier. The first thing
was roll call before the doors of the barracks<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor"><sup>180</sup></a> which every one was
to appear in full dress, well shaved and with hat cocked.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor"><sup>181</sup></a> Then
came breakfast prepared either by one of the company in the camp
kitchen or by each one for himself over the open fire. The breakfast
was anything from the "usual dish, a large plate of rice with
a little salt"<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor"><sup>182</sup></a> to a heavier meal of meat and potatoes.</p>

and tat-too.</p>

<p>Camp life was, however, not all a routine of reveille,
prayers, drills, meals, and tat-too for there were hundreds of other
things which had to be done. There were huts to build<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor"><sup>186</sup></a>, roads to

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>

<p>It can hardly be said that any hard and fast rule was
followed in the matter of camp activities for there were circumstances
continually arising which altered affairs; there were parades before
a visiting officer,<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor"><sup>196</sup></a> and days taken off for washing. Then, too, there
was the lack of a permanent organization of the army, which was a
serious hindrance in following any different course, for the short
time enlistment men were constantly leaving and the new recruits
were coming into camp, all of which broke into the routine of camp<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor"><sup>197</sup></a>
and often nothing of importance was accomplished for weeks at a time.
Simon Lyman of Sharon wrote of the week following August 29, 1775.
"Friday, 29th, In the forenoon we went round the town, and in the
afternoon we putted up our tents and marched through Cambridge to
Charlestound, there we was stationed, we put up our tents.</p>

<p>Tuesday, 3th I rubbed up my gun and looked round the
forts.</p>

<p>Wednesday 4th w(eg)ot some boards to fix out tents and
it rained and we did not do it.</p>

<p>Thursday 5th It rained, and I wrote a letter home and
staid around the house."<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor"><sup>198</sup></a></p>

<p>When the new recruit was given the duty of being on
guard with the orders that he was not to sleep or leave his post
he felt for the first time the hand of authority, he felt that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
orders were ridiculous when he must shave every day and appear
at roll call every morning with his hair powdered, but when he could not
go more than a mile from camp without a pass and that only two furloughs
were allowed at one time,<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor"><sup>199</sup></a> then he was sure that his personal
liberty was imposed upon.</p>

<p>It was just that attitude taken by the soldiers toward
their officers and the orders given by them or toward the duties
they were ordered to perform that made the question of discipline
a serious one. Army life was a novelty at first, but before many
weeks had passed the aspect changed. The soldiers were in new conditions
and new modes of doing things had to be learned. What to do
and what not to do were questions with the new recruits. There had
been little of the "being ordered" by anybody at home especially
among the New Englanders.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor"><sup>200</sup></a> Now the private had to salute, take
orders from and ask permission of an individual, who in all probability
had been his next door neighbor at home with no more training
than himself and perhaps one who had just "taken" command without
having been appointed by the proper authority.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor"><sup>201</sup></a></p>

<p>The trouble came from both sides; the officer felt the
importance of his position to such an extent that he could not see
the private's view point, but on the other hand the private was not
willing to endure an ordinary amount of subordination.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
The orders sent out from headquarters concerning the matter were
numerous depicting to the soldiers and to the officers as well,
their duties and privileges.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor"><sup>202</sup></a> The question of discipline was one
which caused Washington a great deal of concern on first entering
camp,<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor"><sup>203</sup></a> and a matter which always brought comment from the foreigners
who visited our camps or worked with our army.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor"><sup>204</sup></a> As the war progressed
the conditions grew better, but the personnel changed so often that
one group just reached the stage where some sort of law and order
was made possible when they left and the whole process was to be
gone through again with the newly enlisted group.</p>

<p>The general rules of discipline were laid down by the
Continental Congress in what were called "The Rules and Regulations
for the Government of the Army". Congress there described the general
conduct of the soldiers, as to their duties and privileges and
also recommended the punishments which should be inflicted by the
court martial in case of violation of the rules by any one.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor"><sup>205</sup></a>
There were also orders issued from headquarters, which gave more detailed
directions in respect to the personal appearance of the soldier,
how his hat should be cocked, how his hair should be cut,
and the like,31 others in respect to the duties of the soldier on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>

the punishment for stealing, and numerous other things which were
incident to camp life, as the regulation of 'Grog shops'<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor"><sup>207</sup></a> orders,
concerning the morale of the soldiers,<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor"><sup>208</sup></a> and health precautions.</p>

<p>The means of enforcing the disciplinary rules was the
court martial, an instrument which is of common use in time of war,
but some of the trials and decisions of the revolutionary court
martial are interesting if not amusing and yet significant because
of the state of affairs which they reflect.</p>

<p>First as to the organization of the court martial, there
was to be a general and a regimental court, the general, the higher
and the regimental the lower court. The general court was to consist
of not less than thirteen members none of whom were to be under
the rank of a commissioned officer and the president was to be a
field officer. The regimental court was to consist of not more than
five members and in case five could not be assembled three were sufficient,
and any commissioned officer of a regiment by the appointment
of his colonel could hold the court in the regiment for minor
cases.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor"><sup>209</sup></a></p>

<p>All crimes not capital and all disorders and neglect
that officers and soldiers might be guilty of, though not mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
in the Articles of war, were to be taken into a general or regimental
court according to the nature of the crime. The offense could be
punished at the court's discretion, but no one was to be sentenced
to death except in the cases mentioned in the rules layed down by
congress and no sentence was to be executed until the commanding
officer had approved it. The commanding officer also had the power
to pardon or suspend sentence if he saw fit. According to the organization
of the court martial, it was to inflict at its own discretion
only degrading, cashiering, drumming out of camp and whipping
not exceeding thirty-nine lashes.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor"><sup>210</sup></a></p>

<p>According to entries made in orderly books and diaries,
those orders were often overlooked and the originality of the members
of the court was worked into service.</p>

<p>Thacher said of the punishments ordered by the court
martial "Death has been inflicted in a few instances of an atrocious
nature, but in general, the punishment consists in a public whipping,
and the number of stripes is proportioned to the degree of
offense. The law of Moses prescribing forty stripes save one but
that number has often been exceeded in our camp. In aggravated
cases, and with old offenders in our camp the culprit is sentenced
to receive one hundred lashes or more. It is the duty of the drummers
and fifers to inflict the chastisement, and the drum major must
attend and see that the duty is faithfully performed. The culprit
being securely tied to a tree or post receives on his naked back
the number of lashes assigned him by a whip formed of several small
knotted cords which sometimes cut through the skin at every stroke.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
However, strange it may appear, a soldier will often receive the
severest stripes without uttering a groan or once shrinking from
the lash even while the blood flows freely from the lacerated wounds.</p>

<p>"They have now, however, adopted a method which they say
mitigates the anguish in some measure. It is by putting between
the teeth a leaden bullet, on which they chew while under the lash
till it is made quite flat and jagged. In some instances of incorrigibles
villians it is adjudged by the court that the culprit receive
his punishment at several different times, a certain number of
stripes repeated at intervals of two or three days in which case
the wounds are in a state of inflammation, and the skin rendered tender
and the terror of the punishment is greatly aggravated.</p>

<p>"Another mode of punishment is that of running the gauntlet,
this is done by a company of soldiers standing in two lines,
each one furnished with a switch and the criminal is made to run between
them and receive the scourge from their hands on his naked
back; but the delinquent runs so rapidly and the soldiers are so apt
to favor a comrade that it often happens in this way punishment is
very slight".<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor"><sup>211</sup></a></p>

<p>Boardman thus recorded a punishment, "This morning another
rifleman was drummed out of camp not whipped, but if he ever returns
again he is to receive thirty lashes."<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor"><sup>212</sup></a> Other punishments were
riding the wooden horse for fifteen minutes with two guns tied to
the victim's feet and then ten minutes without guns, or riding a
rail. There were, too, the fines and imprisonments, but often the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
the penalties bordered on the humorous line and furnished real
amusement to the rest of the soldiers, one man was sentenced to wear
"A clogg chained at his legg for three days, another was to wear a
clog four days with his coat turned wrong side outwards".<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor"><sup>213</sup></a> The
last penalty was for Major Carnes's cordage. Trials were held for
anything from disorderly conduct or stealing a shirt to treason.</p>

<p>In the court martial and its actions it is possible
to see a reflection of England and the methods of torture used there.
The colonists had not been away from the mother country long enough
to get away from those devices for the punishment of offenders.</p>

<p>The number and kind of trials also show that the soldiers
as a rule were inclined to have their own way and disregard orders
for the majority of the trials were for the disobedience of minor
orders.</p>

<p>A study of conditions during the Revolutionary War in
the light of the present day and especially in the light of the
Great War with the care given the soldiers in the way of housing,
medical aid, sanitation and recreation makes the soldier of 1776
more of a hero than he had been before. That he under the most
adverse circumstances withstood the war conditions and came out
victorious for liberty seems almost a miracle.</p>

<p>John Adams described the continental army as follows:
"Our Army at Crown point is an object of wretchness enough to fill
a human mind with horror, disgraced, defeated, discontented, dispirited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
diseased, naked, undisciplined, eaten up with vermin, no
clothes, bed, blankets, no medicines, no vituals but salt pork and
flour". One almost wonders that it is not a true characterization
but it is interesting to note that of the fifty diaries and journals
studied only one or two reflected a pronounced discontented or dissatisified
spirit, the others mentioned the sufferings and hardships
but did not complain.</p>

<p>The leaders of the War for Independnece have long been
appreciated for the part they played, perhaps over appreciated.
But the leaders could not have accomplished their goal had it not
been for the private. The private was undisciplined it is true and
willful at times, but to him with his sufferings, hardships and even
willfullness must be given a great amount of the honor.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
